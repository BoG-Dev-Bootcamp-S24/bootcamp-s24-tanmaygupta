                    <h3> So What is F1 </h3>
                    <br>
                    <p> Formula 1 (F1) is the premier motorsport featuring top drivers racing high-performance 
                        cars on circuits worldwide. Known for its advanced technology, strategic pit stops, 
                        and intense competition, F1 culminates in a World Champion crowned at the end of each season.
                        With its global audience and blend of speed and skill, F1 is a thrilling spectacle.

                    <h3> The Journey to F1 </h3>
                    <br>
                    <p> Aspiring F1 drivers typically start in karting or junior racing series, then progress through
                        Formula 4, Formula 3, and Formula 2, gaining experience and catching the attention of F1 teams. 
                        Successful racers may become test or reserve drivers before securing a full-time seat in Formula 1, 
                        requiring a lot of talent, determination, and financial support.

                    <h3> Why I Love F1</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p> I'm captivated by Formula 1 because it's more than just cars racing around a trackâ€”it's about the
                        intense competition, strategic maneuvers, and human stories behind every race. The adrenaline 
                        rush of watching drivers push themselves to the limit on circuits worldwide and the brilliance 
                        of human ingenuity in every aspect of the sport keep me hooked. Formula 1 isn't just a race; 
                        it's a thrilling experience that ignites my passion like nothing else.
